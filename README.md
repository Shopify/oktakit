# oktakit

Ruby toolkit for the [Okta API](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/design_principles.html).

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Shopify/oktakit.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Shopify/oktakit)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/oktakit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/oktakit)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'oktakit'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

`Oktakit` follows similar patterns as found in [`Octokit`](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb). So if you are familiar with Oktakit, then you should feel right at home.

```ruby
client = Oktakit.new(token: 't0k3n', organization: 'my-great-org')
response, http_status = client.list_users
```

#### Developer organization
Pass the 'developer_org' flag as option on client initialization in case you don't have a production okta account yet. This will change the API endpoint to oktapreview.com.

```ruby
client = Oktakit.new(token: 't0k3n', organization: 'my-great-org', developer_org: true)
response, http_status = client.list_users
```

#### Pagination
Pass the `paginate` flag as options for any `get` action for Oktakit to autopaginate the response for you.

```ruby
client = Oktakit.new(token: 't0k3n', organization: 'my-great-org')
response, http_status = client.list_users(paginate: true)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

Testing is fairly straightforward, with the exception of the org URL.
To anonymize the VCR data, first setup a real token and endpoint for Okta, such as `myokta.okta.com`

- In `spec_helper.rb`, set the org to `my-okta` (or whatever your organization is).
- Set the `OKTA_TEST_TOKEN` environment variable (this should be real). Don't worry, it is automatically removed.
- Before committing, change `my-okta` to `okta-test` in `spec_helper.rb` and any VCR Cassettes.

The [API Test Client](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/api_test_client) provided by Okta is also really helpful.
